* Agonafir et al. (2022), NYC 311 flooding
:PROPERTIES:
:DATA: 311 calls, Stage IV precipitation
:YEAR: 2022
:CASES: NYC
:METHOD: negative binomial GLM with LASSO, ZIP code aggregated
:FLOODTYPE: pluvial
:END:

- aggregates 311 calls to ZIP code weeks
- predicts flooding calls on the basis of infra. related calls + precip.
- notes that future work could include rainfall intensity
