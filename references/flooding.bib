	abstract = {Traditional methodologies of flood monitoring are generally time-consuming and demanding tasks. In most cases, there is no possibility of flood monitoring in large areas. Due to the major drawbacks of conventional methods in flood detection of large districts, Remote Sensing (RS) has been efficiently employed as the best solution owing to its being synoptic view and cost-effective methodologies. One of the most challenging issues in RS technologies is choosing the optimal spectral bands to detect changes in the natural environment. In this research, Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE), as one of the most widely used Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques, was applied to select the optimal bands of Sentinel-2 satellite images for detection of flood-affected areas. For this purpose, the decision-making method was implemented during ten options and six criteria. The properties of the Sentinel-2 satellite images consisted of ten bands (with 10 and 20m spatial resolutions) and the criteria are the signal to noise ratio (SNR) related to sensor, standard deviation, variance, the SNR related to the bands, spatial resolution, and wavelength. Afterward, the ELECTRE technique was used to select six optimal bands among ten bands. The ELECTRE algorithm was programmed in MATLAB programming language that could make decisions with multiple options and multiple criteria. Furthermore, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method, as one of the most powerful Machine Learning (ML) models, has been applied to classify the water bodies related to before and after the flood. According to the results of optimal bands classification, Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (KC) for the pre-flood classification were 93.65 percent and 0.923, respectively, and for the post-flood classification, the OA and KC values were 94.52 percent and 0.935 respectively. In the case of before and after flooding, the results of classification model for optimal bands had more accuracy levels in comparison with those obtained by original bands. Generally, it was found that the ELECTRE technique for selecting the best bands of Sentinel-2 satellite images and detection of flood-affected areas, in a short period of time with high accuracy, offers remarkable and consistent results.

	abstract = {"Global flood hazard modeling and forecasting has many challenges but at the same time there is a lot of room for development and opportunities along the way for addressing these challenges, which recent advances in global flood hazard mapping, modeling, and forecasting evidently demonstrate. Efforts to advance the fields should focus on achieving better accuracy of global model boundary data sets such as precipitation estimates, streamflow simulation, digital elevation models, and also correct implementation of local scale features highly important for flood propagation. This would increase our current ability to simulate floodplain inundation at the global scale more accurately. Output usability of models can be improved by integrating global models efficiently with remotely sensed observations of floods. Thus, there is a need not only to understand the limitations and errors of data and methods but also to develop more sophisticated data processing algorithms, as well as robust frameworks for handling the many heterogeneous geospatial data sets and for effective information management. Despite the many challenges that exist at present and need to be overcome, the science and applications of global flood hazard estimation is currently a fast-moving field with much more significant progress to be expected in upcoming years"--Provided by publisher's website.},

This volume details the latest remote sensing techniques for flood monitoring and mapping, including use of optical data from geostationary sensors and LEO spacecraft, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data analysis, and data fusion. Detailed case studies from a variety of subject experts illustrate these tools and techniques. Accurate monitoring of flood events is increasingly necessary to gain insight about both causes and remedies. Floods are one of the most destructive hazards to the human populations, they can occur practically everywhere on the Earth surface, and each year cause considerable harm and damage to infrastructures. The recent Flood directive in European Countries is contributing to a more quantitative approach to flood hazard and risk evaluation. .},

	abstract = {Extreme precipitation events (EPEs) have the potential to create catastrophic flooding, landslides, and infrastructure damage. We diagnose the spatial and temporal characteristics of EPEs by using the Integrated Multi‐SatellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement mission (GPM; IMERG) precipitation estimates to construct spatial‐temporal (xy‐t) EPEs that depict both the spatial extent and temporal evolution of precipitation systems. EPEs were constructed using a recursive‐fractal approach to classify the precipitating grids across space and time as belonging to the same system, thus identifying events. This classification enables the accurate depiction of duration, areal coverage, total volume, and propagation of each EPE over its entire life cycle. Results from 4 years of IMERG statistics over the contiguous United States show that the most frequent EPEs have duration between 3 and 6 hr, an affected area of 103–5 × 104 km2, and a total precipitation volume of 106–108 m3. Spatially, EPEs occur most frequently in the northwest and northeast in the winter and spring and the southwest and southeast in summer. Fall has the least number of EPEs, and summer exhibits some of the heaviest and largest precipitation events. The diurnal cycle in frequency and precipitation volume is most prominent in summer, weaker in spring and fall, and is not discernible in winter, especially for events lasting fewer than 6 hr. The event propagation speeds indicate the influence of large‐scale circulations as winter events tend to move faster than those in the other seasons.
Key Points

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the decrease of temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence could be exploited to detect the appearance of floodwater in urban areas. However, as of today, approaches based on this principle only make use of single co-polarization images for identifying the presence of floodwater in the double-bounce feature. In this study, we take advantage of both co- and cross-polarization images to detect significant decreases of the multitemporal InSAR coherence in order to enhance the mapping of floodwater in urban areas. We consider that not only double-bounce scattering, but also multiple-bounce may occur in urban areas depending on how the building facades are oriented with respect to the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor's line of sight. The Sentinel-1 (S-1) mission is particularly well suited for applying and testing this kind of approach due to the systematic availability of dual-polarization data. Using as a test case, the widespread flooding in the city of Houston, USA, caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2017, we demonstrate that the proposed methodology leads to an increase of the accuracy of the urban flood maps from 75.2\% when only using the VV polarization, to 82.9\% when using the dual polarization information.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we assess the flood mapping capabilities of the X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery acquired by the bistatic pair TanDEM-X/TerraSAR-X (TDX/TSX). The main objective is to investigate the added value of the bistatic TDX/TSX Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence in addition to the SAR backscatter in the context of inundation mapping. As a classifier, we consider a Random Forest (RF) classification scheme using TDX/TSX SAR intensities and their bistatic InSAR coherence to extract the flood extent map. To evaluate the classification results and as no “ground truth” was available at the SAR data acquisition time, we set up a LISFLOOD-FP hydraulic model for simulating the temporal evolution of the flood water. The flood map simulated by the model shows good performances with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 97.92 \% and a Critical Success Index (CSI) of 94 . 01 \% . The SAR-derived flood map is then compared to the LISFLOOD-FP extent map simulated at the SAR data acquisition time. As a test case, we consider the flooding event of the Richelieu River that occurred in the Montérégie region of Quebec (Canada) from April to June 2011. Experimental results highlight the potential of the bistatic InSAR coherence for more accurate flood mapping in a complex landscape with urban and vegetation areas. The classification results of the SAR-derived flood map with respect to the LISFLOOD-FP flood map reach an OA of 78.65 \% and a Precision of 82.08 \% when integrating the bistatic InSAR coherence. These classification OA and Precision values are 69.63 \% and 64.52 \% , respectively, using only the TDX/TSX SAR intensity.},

	abstract = {Due to the complexity of backscattering mechanisms in built-up areas, the synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based mapping of floodwater in urban areas remains challenging. Open areas affected by flooding have low backscatter due to the specular reflection of calm water surfaces. Floodwater within built-up areas leads to double-bounce effects, the complexity of which depends on the configuration of floodwater concerning the facades of the surrounding buildings. Hence, it has been shown that the analysis of interferometric SAR coherence reduces the underdetection of floods in urbanized areas. Moreover, the high potential of deep convolutional neural networks for advancing SAR-based flood mapping is widely acknowledged. Therefore, we introduce an urban-aware U-Net model using dual-polarization Sentinel-1 multitemporal intensity and coherence data to map the extent of flooding in urban environments. It uses a priori information (i.e., an SAR-derived probabilistic urban mask) in the proposed urban-aware module, consisting of channel-wise attention and urban-aware normalization submodules to calibrate features and improve the final predictions. In this study, Sentinel-1 single-look complex data acquired over four study sites from three continents have been considered. The qualitative evaluation and quantitative analysis have been carried out using six urban flood cases. A comparison with previous methods reveals a significant enhancement in the accuracy of urban flood mapping: the F1 score of flooded urban increased from 0.3 to 0.6 with few false alarms in urban area using our method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model trained with limited datasets has strong potential for near-real-time urban flood mapping.},

This paper considers a method for detecting flooding in urban areas by merging near real-time SAR flood extents with model-derived flood hazard maps. This allows a two-way symbiosis, whereby currently available SAR urban flood extent improves future model flood predictions, while flood hazard maps obtained after the SAR overpasses improve the SAR estimate of urban flood extents. The method estimates urban flooding using SAR backscatter only in rural areas adjacent to urban ones. It was compared to an existing method using SAR returns in both rural and urban areas. The method using SAR solely in rural areas gave an average flood detection accuracy of 94\% and a false positive rate of 9\% in the urban areas and was more accurate than the existing method.},

We applied a novel C-band Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based flood detection method to map floodwater distribution following three recent severe weather events with the goal of identifying areas that are prone to future flood hazards. Attempts were made to calibrate and validate the C-band-based results and analyses to compensate for possible sources of error. These included qualitative and quantitative assessments on L-band aerial SAR data, as well as aerial imagery acquired after one of the events. The findings included the following: (1) most urban centers of Harris county, with few exceptions, are not believed to be prone to flooding hazards in contrast to the densely populated areas on the outskirts of Harris county; (2) nearly 44\% of the mapped flood-prone areas lie within a 1 km distance of major drainage networks; (3) areas experiencing high subsidence rates have persistently experienced flooding, possibly exacerbated by morphological changes to the land surface induced by subsidence.},

Thus, from a satellite’s optical sensor, the flood area is mostly covered with clouds which indicates ineffective observation. One solution to this problem is to use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors by observing backscatter differences before and after flood events. This research proposes mapping the flood-prone areas using machine learning to classify the areas using the 3D CNN method. The method was applied on a combination of co-polarized and cross-polarized SAR multi-temporal image datasets covering Jakarta City and the coastal area of Bekasi Regency. Testing with multiple combinations of training/testing data proportion split and a different number of epochs gave the optimum performance at an 80/20 split with 150 epochs achieving an overall accuracy of 0.71 after training in 283 min.},

	abstract = {A near real-time flood detection algorithm giving a synoptic overview of the extent of flooding in both urban and rural areas, and capable of working during night-time and day-time even if cloud was present, could be a useful tool for operational flood relief management. The paper describes an automatic algorithm using high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data that builds on existing approaches, including the use of image segmentation techniques prior to object classification to cope with the very large number of pixels in these scenes. Flood detection in urban areas is guided by the flood extent derived in adjacent rural areas. The algorithm assumes that high-resolution topographic height data are available for at least the urban areas of the scene, in order that a SAR simulator may be used to estimate areas of radar shadow and layover. The algorithm proved capable of detecting flooding in rural areas using TerraSAR-X with good accuracy, classifying 89\% of flooded pixels correctly, with an associated false positive rate of 6\%. Of the urban water pixels visible to TerraSAR-X, 75\% were correctly detected, with a false positive rate of 24\%. If all urban water pixels were considered, including those in shadow and layover regions, these figures fell to 57\% and 18\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing has been widely used for flood mapping and monitoring. Nevertheless, flood detection in urban areas still proves to be particularly challenging by using SAR. In this paper, we assess the roles of SAR intensity and interferometric coherence in urban flood detection using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data. We further introduce an active self-learning convolution neural network (A-SL CNN) framework to alleviate the effect of a limited annotated training dataset. The proposed framework selects informative unlabeled samples based on a temporal-ensembling CNN model. These samples are subsequently pseudo-labeled by a multi-scale spatial filter. Consistency regularization is introduced to penalize incorrect labels caused by pseudo-labeling. We show results for a case study that is centered on flooded areas in Houston, USA, during hurricane Harvey in August 2017. Our experiments show that multi-temporal intensity (pre- and co-event) plays the most important role in urban flood detection. Adding multi-temporal coherence can increase the reliability of the inundation map considerably. Meanwhile, encouraging results are achieved by the proposed A-SL CNN framework: the к statistic is improved from 0.614 to 0.686 in comparison to its supervised counterpart.},

	abstract = {Urban flooding causes a variation in radar return from urban areas. However, such variation has not been thoroughly examined for different polarizations because of the lack of polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images and ground truth data simultaneously collected over flooded urban areas. This condition hinders not only the understanding of the effect mechanism of urban flooding under different polarizations but also the development of advanced methods that could improve the accuracy of inundated urban area detection. Using Sentinel-1 PolSAR and Jilin-1 high-resolution optical images acquired on the same day over flooded urban areas in Golestan, Iran, this study investigated the characteristics and mechanisms of the radar return changes induced by urban flooding under different polarizations and proposed a new method for unsupervised inundated urban area detection. This study found that urban flooding caused a backscattering coefficient increase (BCI) and interferometric coherence decrease (ICD) in VV and VH polarizations. Furthermore, VV polarization was more sensitive to the BCI and ICD than VH polarization. In light of these findings, the ratio between the BCI and ICD was defined as an urban flooding index (UFI), and the UFI in VV polarization was used for the unsupervised detection of flooded urban areas. The overall accuracy, detection accuracy, and false alarm rate attained by the UFI-based method were 96.93\%, 91.09\%, and 0.95\%, respectively. Compared with the conventional unsupervised method based on the ICD and that based on the fusion of backscattering coefficients and interferometric coherences (FBI), the UFI-based method achieved higher overall accuracy. The performance of VV was evaluated and compared to that of VH in the flooded urban area detection using the UFI-, ICD-, and FBI-based methods, respectively. VV polarization produced higher overall accuracy than VH polarization in all the methods, especially in the UFI-based method. By using VV instead of VH polarization, the UFI-based method improved the detection accuracy by 38.16\%. These results indicated that the UFI-based method improved flooded urban area detection by synergizing the BCI and ICD in VV polarization.},

In particular, digital elevation models (DEMs) may directly influence the performance of flood predictions and improper representation of complex urban features including buildings and bridges may lead to incorrect prediction of flooding paths and extents, and consequently miscalculate flood risk. In this work, a geographic information system (GIS)-based correction method is proposed to make modifications in high-resolution DEMs by adding building complexes and removing unphysical representations of bridges for a more realistic description of flood paths in considering the flow connectivity in intensely urbanized areas and with the objective of obtaining more accurate flood simulation results. The proposed DEM correction method is applied to support large-scale urban flood modelling in Fuzhou City, China, using an established hydrodynamic flood model known as High-Performance Integrated hydrodynamic Modelling System (HiPIMS). Comparisons are made to the simulation results with and without the DEM improvements using the proposed correction method. The results demonstrate that correct representation of the artificial structures in the urban DEM can significantly improve the flood simulation results.},

High-accuracy fully supervised methods are the main methods for CD tasks at present. However, these methods require a large amount of labeled data consisting of bi-temporal images and their change maps. Moreover, creating change maps takes a lot of labor and time. To address this limitation, a simple semi-supervised change detection method based on consistency regularization and strong augmentation is proposed in this paper. First, we construct a Siamese nested UNet with graph attention mechanism (SANet) and pre-train it with a small amount of labeled data. Then, we feed the unlabeled data into the pre-trained SANet and confidence threshold filter to obtain pseudo-labels with high confidence. At the same time, we produce distorted images by performing strong augmentation on unlabeled data. The model is trained to make the CD results of the distorted images consistent with the corresponding pseudo-label. Extensive experiments are conducted on two high-resolution remote sensing datasets. The results demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the performance of change detection under insufficient labels. Our methods can increase the IoU by more than 25\% compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Urban flooding is a frequent problem affecting cities all over the world. The problem is more significant now that the climate is changing and urbanization trends are increasing. Various, physical hydrological models such as the Environmental Protection Agency Storm Water Management Model (EPA SWMM), MIKE URBAN-II and others, have been developed to simulate flooding events in cities. However, they require high accuracy mapping and a simulation of the underground storm drainage system. Sadly, this capability is usually not available for older or larger so-called megacities. Other hydrological model types are classified in the semi-physical category, like Cellular Automata (CA), require the incorporation of very fine resolution data. These types of data, in turn, demand massive computer power and time for analysis. Furthermore, available forecasting systems provide a way to determine total rainfall during extreme events, but they do not tell us what areas will be flooded. This work introduces an urban flooding tool that couples a rainfall-runoff model with a flood map database to expedite the alert process and estimate flooded areas. A 0.30-m Lidar Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the study area (in this case Manhattan, New York City) is divided into 140 sub-basins. Several flood maps for each sub-basin are generated and organized into a database. For any forecasted extreme rainfall event, the rainfall-runoff model predicts the expected runoff volume at different times during the storm interval. The system rapidly searches for the corresponding flood map that delineates the expected flood area. The sensitivity analysis of parameters in the model show that the effect of storm inlet flow head is approximately linear while the effects of the threshold infiltration rate, the number of storm inlets, and the storm inlet flow reduction factor are non-linear. The reduction factor variation is found to exhibit a high non-linearity variation, hence requiring further detailed investigation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we describe a new method of modeling coastal inundation arising from storm surge by coupling a widely used storm surge model (ADCIRC) and an urban flood inundation model (FloodMap). This is the first time the coupling of such models is implemented and tested using real events. The method offers a flexible and efficient procedure for applying detailed ADCIRC storm surge modeling results along the coastal boundary (with typical resolution of ∼100 m) to FloodMap for fine resolution inundation modeling ({\textless}5 m). The coastal inundation during Hurricane Sandy was simulated at both the city (New York City) and subregional (lower Manhattan) scales with various resolutions. Results obtained from the ADCIRC and coupled ADCIRC‐FloodMap simulations were compared with the recorded (high water marks) and derived (inundation extent based on the planar method) data from FEMA. At the city scale, coupled ADCIRC‐FloodMap modeling demonstrates improved prediction over ADCIRC modeling alone for both the extent and depth of inundation. The advantage of the coupled model is further illustrated in the subregional modeling, using a mesh resolution of 3 m which is substantially finer than the inland mesh resolution used by ADCIRC ({\textgreater}70 m). In further testing, we explored the effects of mesh resolution and roughness specification. Results agree with previous studies that fine resolution is essential for capturing intricate flow paths and connectivity in urban topography. While the specification of roughness is more challenging for urban environments, it may be empirically optimized. The successful coupling of ADCIRC and FloodMap models for fine resolution coastal inundation modeling unlocks the potential for undertaking large numbers of probabilistically based synthetic surge events for street‐level risk analysis.

A total of 2450 data points have been used to build and evaluate the model over four different areas with different vegetation and urban density. The results indicated that by using PolInSAR and SAR simulated reflectivity maps together with five auxiliary features, a classification overall accuracy of 93.1\% in urban areas was obtained, representing a 9.6\% improvement over using the five auxiliary features alone.},

Results indicate that interactions between the urban area and land–sea boundary have an important impact on the spatial variability of both heavy rainfall and flooding, sometimes in contrast to results obtained for other cities. Top days of daily and hourly rainfall exhibit a rainfall maximum over the city center and an extended region of higher rainfall downwind of the city. The mechanism for flooding appears to vary across the city, with high groundwater tables influencing more coastal areas and high rain rates or large rain volumes influencing more inland areas. There is also a strong relationship between sewer type and flood frequency, with fewer floods observed in combined sewer areas. Flooding is driven by maximum one-hour to one-day rainfall, which is often substantially less rain than observed for the city-wide daily maximum.},

            In urban areas, the presence of impervious surfaces limits natural drainage and routes water to stormwater infrastructure with finite capacity, making these areas especially prone to flooding. Though large floods are responsible for endangering lives and causing extensive damage, there is growing evidence that more frequent floods with shallow water depths, termed nuisance flooding, can have a high cumulative cost and many direct and indirect damages. To determine whether locations of nuisance flooding may be linked to topography, we took a parsimonious, spatially distributed approach to explore whether high topographic index values co‐occur with citizen‐reported nuisance flooding. We obtained nuisance flood reports from the municipal data service 311 for several watersheds in New York City and Baltimore, USA. Our analysis tested two topographic indices (TI)—topographic wetness index (TWI) and sink depth—both calculated from high‐resolution ({\textasciitilde}1 m) digital elevation models. Generally, our findings suggest that not all but many locations of reported flooding tend to coincide with deep sinks or large TWI. However, nuisance flooding reports most commonly coincided with deep sinks and high TWI when using a maximum, instead of coincident, TI value extracted around each reported location of flooding, an approach we used due to the uncertainty in location accuracy of flooding reports. Overall, our results show promise for application of topographic indices, typically applied in more natural settings, as indicators of nuisance flooding areas in urbanized environments. Although limitations to this approach exist, the application of TIs and crowd‐sourced reporting in tandem could provide a useful starting point for mapping flood‐prone areas in many cities with technologically adept community members and ample geospatial data.},

	abstract = {The knowledge of impervious surfaces, especially the magnitude, location, geometry, spatial pattern of impervious surfaces and the perviousness–imperviousness ratio, is significant to a range of issues and themes in environmental science central to global environmental change and human–environment interactions. Impervious surface data is important for urban planning and environmental and resources management. Therefore, remote sensing of impervious surfaces in the urban areas has recently attracted unprecedented attention. In this paper, various digital remote sensing approaches to extract and estimate impervious surfaces will be examined. Discussions will focus on the mapping requirements of urban impervious surfaces. In particular, the impacts of spatial, geometric, spectral, and temporal resolutions on the estimation and mapping will be addressed, so will be the selection of an appropriate estimation method based on remotely sensed data characteristics. This literature review suggests that major approaches over the past decade include pixel-based (image classification, regression,
etc.), sub-pixel based (linear spectral unmixing, imperviousness as the complement of vegetation fraction
etc.), object-oriented algorithms, and artificial neural networks. Techniques, such as data/image fusion, expert systems, and contextual classification methods, have also been explored. The majority of research efforts have been made for mapping urban landscapes at various scales and on the spatial resolution requirements of such mapping. In contrast, there is less interest in spectral and geometric properties of impervious surfaces. More researches are also needed to better understand temporal resolution, change and evolution of impervious surfaces over time, and temporal requirements for urban mapping. It is suggested that the models, methods, and image analysis algorithms in urban remote sensing have been largely developed for the imagery of medium resolution (10–100
m). The advent of high spatial resolution satellite images, spaceborne hyperspectral images, and LiDAR data is stimulating new research idea, and is driving the future research trends with new models and algorithms.

	abstract = {High-quality and high-resolution precipitation products are critically important to many hydrological applications. Advances in satellite remote sensing instruments and data retrieval algorithms continue to improve the quality of the operational precipitation products. However, most satellite products existing today are still too coarse to be ingested for local water management and planning purposes. Recent advances in deep learning algorithms enable the fusion of multi-source, high-dimensional data for statistical learning. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of an attention-based, deep convolutional neural network (AU-Net) for learning spatial and temporal mappings from coarse-resolution to fine-resolution precipitation products. The skills of AU-Net models, developed using combinations of static and dynamic predictors, were evaluated over a 3 × 3° study area in Central Texas, U.S., a region known for its complex precipitation patterns and low predictability. Three coarse-resolution satellite/reanalysis precipitation products, ERA5-Land (0.1°), TRMM (0.25°), and IMERG (0.1°), are used as part of the inputs, while the predictand is the 1-km PRISM data. Auxiliary predictors include elevation, vegetation index, and air temperature. The study period includes 18 years of data (2001–2018) at the monthly scale for training, validation, and testing. Results show that the trained AU-Net models achieve different degrees of success in downscaling the baseline coarse-resolution products, depending on the total precipitation, the accuracy of large-scale patterns captured by the baseline products, and the amount of information transferable from predictors. Higher precipitation rate tends to affect AU-Net model performance negatively. Use of the attention mechanism in the AU-Net models allows for infilling of multiscale features and generation of sharper images. Correction using gauge data, if there is any, can further improve the results significantly.},

These extreme precipitation events were mainly associated with Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) and brought about 174 km

              of water to California according to ground observations. This article evaluates the performance of six commonly used satellite‐based precipitation products (IMERG, 3B42RT, PERSIANN, CCS, CMORPH and GSMaP), as well as ground‐based radar products (Radar‐only and Radar‐lgc) in capturing the ARs precipitation rate and distribution. It is found that precipitation maps from all products present heavy precipitation in January and February, with more consistent observations over ocean than land. Though large uncertainties exist in quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) over land, the ensemble mean of different remote‐sensing precipitation products over California is consistent with gauge measurements. Among the six satellite‐based products, IMERG correlates the best with gauge observations both in the detection and quantification of precipitation, but it is not the best product in terms of root‐mean‐square error or bias. Compared to satellite products, ground weather radar shows better precipitation detectability and estimation skill. However, neither radar nor satellite QPE products have good performances in quantifying the peak precipitation intensity during the extreme events, suggesting that further advancement in quantification of extremely intense precipitation associated with ARs in the western United States is needed.},

              Climate models face limitations in their ability to accurately represent highly variable atmospheric phenomena. To resolve fine‐scale physical processes, allowing for local impact assessments, downscaling techniques are essential. We propose spateGAN, a novel approach for spatio‐temporal downscaling of precipitation data using conditional generative adversarial networks. Our method is based on a video super‐resolution approach and trained on 10 years of country‐wide radar observations for Germany. It simultaneously increases the spatial and temporal resolution of coarsened precipitation observations from 32 to 2 km and from 1 hr to 10 min. Our experiments indicate that the ensembles of generated temporally consistent rainfall fields are in high agreement with the observational data. Spatial structures with plausible advection were accurately generated. Compared to trilinear interpolation and a classical convolutional neural network, the generative model reconstructs the resolution‐dependent extreme value distribution with high skill. It showed a high fractions skill score of 0.6 (spatio‐temporal scale: 32 km and 1 hr) for rainfall intensities over 15 mm h
              −1
              and a low relative bias of 3.35\%. A power spectrum analysis confirmed that the probabilistic downscaling ability of our model further increased its skill. We observed that neural network predictions may be interspersed by recurrent structures not related to rainfall climatology, which should be a known issue for future studies. We were able to mitigate them by using an appropriate model architecture and model selection process. Our findings suggest that spateGAN offers the potential to complement and further advance the development of climate model downscaling techniques, due to its performance and computational efficiency.

            Plain Language Summary
            Natural disasters like floods, hail, or landslides originate from precipitation. Global climate models are an important tool to understand these hazards and derive expected changes in a future climate. However, they operate on spatial and temporal scales that limit the regional ability to reflect their small‐scale characteristics. This has led to the development of dynamical and statistical downscaling methods. Due to their computational efficiency, machine learning algorithms recently got increased attention as a method for improving the spatial resolution of climate data. Here, we describe a new deep learning model that allows to simultaneously increasing both the temporal and spatial resolution of precipitation data. Our presented approach enhances the spatial resolution by a factor of 16 and the temporal resolution by a factor of 6. The generated rain fields are hardly identifiable as artificially generated and exhibit the typical structure, movement, and distribution of observed rain fields.

Radar rainfall estimates with daily mean field bias (MFB) correction accurately capture the spatial and temporal structure of extreme rainfall, but bias correction at finer timescales can improve cold‐season and tropical cyclone rainfall estimates. Approximately 25 rain gages are sufficient to estimate daily MFB over an area of at least 2,500 km

              Precipitation nowcasting, the high-resolution forecasting of precipitation up to two hours ahead, supports the real-world socioeconomic needs of many sectors reliant on weather-dependent decision-making
              1,2
              . State-of-the-art operational nowcasting methods typically advect precipitation fields with radar-based wind estimates, and struggle to capture important non-linear events such as convective initiations
              3,4
              . Recently introduced deep learning methods use radar to directly predict future rain rates, free of physical constraints
              5,6
              . While they accurately predict low-intensity rainfall, their operational utility is limited because their lack of constraints produces blurry nowcasts at longer lead times, yielding poor performance on rarer medium-to-heavy rain events. Here we present a deep generative model for the probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation from radar that addresses these challenges. Using statistical, economic and cognitive measures, we show that our method provides improved forecast quality, forecast consistency and forecast value. Our model produces realistic and spatiotemporally consistent predictions over regions up to 1,536 km × 1,280 km and with lead times from 5–90 min ahead. Using a systematic evaluation by more than 50 expert meteorologists, we show that our generative model ranked first for its accuracy and usefulness in 89\% of cases against two competitive methods. When verified quantitatively, these nowcasts are skillful without resorting to blurring. We show that generative nowcasting can provide probabilistic predictions that improve forecast value and support operational utility, and at resolutions and lead times where alternative methods struggle.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) over a given region and period is of vital importance across multiple domains and disciplines. However, due to the intricate temporospatial variability and the intermittent nature of precipitation, it is challenging to obtain QPE with adequate accuracy. This paper aims to simulate rainfall fields while honoring both the local constraints imposed by the point-wise rain gauge observations and the global constraints imposed by the field measurements obtained from weather radar. The conditional simulation method employed in this study is modified phase annealing (PA), which is practically an evolution from the traditional simulated annealing (SA). Yet unlike SA, which implements perturbations in the spatial field, PA implements perturbations in Fourier space, making it superior to SA in many respects. PA is developed in two ways. First, taking advantage of the global characteristic of PA, the method is only used to deal with global constraints, and the local ones are handed over to residual kriging. Second, except for the system temperature, the number of perturbed phases is also annealed during the simulation process, making the influence of the perturbation more global at initial phases and decreasing the global impact of the perturbation gradually as the number of perturbed phases decreases. The proposed method is used to simulate the rainfall field for a 30 min event using different scenarios: with and without integrating the uncertainty of the radar-indicated rainfall pattern and with different objective functions.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            A review of existing tools for radar data processing revealed a lack of open source software for automated processing, assessment and analysis of weather radar composites. The ArcGIS-compatible Python package radproc attempts to reduce this gap. Radproc provides an automated raw data processing workflow for nationwide, freely available German weather radar climatology (RADKLIM) and operational (RADOLAN) composite products. Raw data are converted into a uniform HDF5 file structure used by radproc's analysis and data quality assessment functions. This enables transferability of the developed analysis and export functionality to other gridded or point-scale precipitation data. Thus, radproc can be extended by additional import routines to support any other German or non-German precipitation dataset. Analysis methods include temporal aggregations, detection of heavy rainfall and an automated processing of rain gauge point data into the same HDF5 format for comparison to gridded radar data. A set of functions for data exchange with ArcGIS allows for visualisation and further geospatial analysis. The application on a 17-year time series of hourly RADKLIM data showed that radproc greatly facilitates radar data processing and analysis by avoiding manual programming work and helps to lower the barrier for non-specialists to work with these novel radar climatology datasets.},

            Weather radar analysis has become increasingly sophisticated over the past 50 years, and efforts to keep software up to date have generally lagged behind the needs of the users. We argue that progress has been impeded by the fact that software has not been developed and shared as a community.
            Recently, the situation has been changing. In this paper, the developers of a number of open-source software (OSS) projects highlight the potential of OSS to advance radar-related research. We argue that the community-based development of OSS holds the potential to reduce duplication of efforts and to create transparency in implemented algorithms while improving the quality and scope of the software. We also conclude that there is sufficiently mature technology to support collaboration across different software projects. This could allow for consolidation toward a set of interoperable software platforms, each designed to accommodate very specific user requirements.},

              CBAs
              to improve social welfare—a function of well‐being of all individuals, conceptualized by utility. However, today's common practice to value flood risk management benefits as the reduction of the expected annual damages does not comply with this concept of social welfare, since it erroneously focuses on money instead of well‐being (utility). Diminishing marginal utility of money implies that risk aversion and income differences should be taken into account while calculating the social welfare benefits of flood risk management. This is especially important when social vulnerability is high, damage compensation is incomplete and the distribution of income is regarded as unfair and income is not redistributed in other ways. Disagreement, misconception, complexity, untrained professionals, political economy and failing guidance are potential reasons why these concepts are not being applied. Compared to the common practice, a theoretically more sound social welfare approach to
              CBA
              for flood risk management leads to different conclusions on who to target, what to do, how much to invest and how to share risks, with increased emphasis on resiliency measures for population segments with low income and high social vulnerability. The social welfare approach to
              CBA
              , illustrated in this study in the context of floods, can be applied to other climate risks as well, such as storms, droughts, and landslides.

            The authors examine the hydroclimatology, hydrometeorology, and hydrology of flooding in the Milwaukee metropolitan region of the upper midwestern United States. The objectives of this study are 1) to assess nonstationarities in flood frequency associated with urban transformation of land surface properties and climate change and 2) to examine how spatial heterogeneity in land surface properties and heavy rainfall climatology interact to determine floods in urbanizing areas. The authors focus on the Menomonee River basin, which drains much of the urban core of Milwaukee, and the adjacent Cedar Creek basin, where agricultural land use dominates. Results are based on analyses of bias-corrected, high-resolution (1-km2 spatial resolution and 15-min time resolution) radar rainfall fields that are developed using the Hydro-NEXRAD system, rainfall observations from a network of 21 rain gauges in the Milwaukee metropolitan region, and discharge observations from 11 U.S. Geological Survey stream gauging stations. Both annual flood peak magnitudes and annual peaks over threshold flood counts have increased for the Menomonee River basin during the past five decades, and these trends are accompanied by a transition of flood events dominated by snowmelt (March–April floods) to a regime in which warm season thunderstorms are the dominant flood-producing agents. The frequency of heavy rainfall events has increased significantly. The spatial distribution of rainfall for flood-producing storms in the Milwaukee study region exhibits striking spatial heterogeneity, with a maximum in the central portion of the Menomonee River basin. Storm event hydrologic response is determined by the interactions of spatial patterns of urbanization and rainfall distribution in the Menomonee River basin.},

	abstract = {Interactions between spatial and temporal variability of rainfall and catchment characteristics strongly influence hydrological response. In urban areas, where runoff generation is fast due to high imperviousness degree, it is especially relevant to capture the high spatiotemporal rainfall variability. Significant progress has been made in the development of spatially distributed rainfall measurements and of distributed hydrological models, to represent the variability of catchment's characteristics. Interactions between rainfall and basin scales on hydrological response sensitivity, however, needs deeper investigation. A previous study investigated the hydrological response in the small urbanized catchment of Cranbrook (8 km2, London, UK) and proposed three dimensionless “scale factors” to identify if the available rainfall resolution is sufficient to properly predict hydrological response. We aim to verify the applicability of these scale factors to larger scales, with a distinct physiographic setting, in Little Sugar Creek (111 km2, Charlotte, USA), to identify the required rainfall resolution and to predict model performance. Twenty‐eight events were selected from a weather radar data set from the National Weather Radar Network, with a resolution of 1 km2 and 15 min. Rainfall data were aggregated to coarser resolutions and used as input for a distributed hydrological model. Results show that scale factors and associated thresholds are generally applicable for characterization of urban flood response to rainfall across spatiotemporal scales. Additionally, application of scale factors in observation‐based analysis supports identification of event characteristics that are poorly captured and critical improvements that need to be made before the model can benefit from high‐resolution rainfall. Key Points Rainfall aggregation has high impact on the hydrological response in urban areas Characterization of rainfall spatial and temporal scales plays a significant role in the estimation of hydrological response sensitivity Combination of rainfall and catchment critical scales strongly affects the sensitivity of the hydrological response},

	abstract = {Citization significantly changes original surface properties. City areas can cause surface winds to decrease; furthermore, ground friction can be transferred layer by layer through the momentum exchange of air movement, which affects the air layers above. Precipitation modification by city environments has been an active research area. Under the conditions of high wind speed, the dynamic effects of cities on precipitation are relatively obvious. Generally, the dynamic effects fall into two main categories: (1) for weather systems under weak forcing synoptic backgrounds, such as local convective systems, shorter-lived extreme precipitation events and fronts and city barrier effects can delay the movement of weather systems, directly change the horizontal distribution characteristics and occurrence time for precipitation, change the flow field and structure, cause the bifurcation of weather systems, and change the horizontal distribution characteristics of precipitation; (2) for weather systems under strong forcing synoptic backgrounds, such as extratropical systems (with large-scale moisture transport), monsoon systems, landfalling tropical cyclones, and supercell storms, the impact of the dynamic effects of cities cannot lead to the bifurcation of the weather system, nor can it change the horizontal distribution characteristics of the whole precipitation field, but it can have an impact on the local precipitation intensity and distribution. However, currently, people do not agree on the impact of cities on precipitation, especially regarding tropical cyclones. Hence, we provide a review and provide insights into the dynamic effects of cities on precipitation.},

To develop a comprehensive understanding of rainfall modification due to urbanization, a systematic meta-analysis is undertaken. The initial search identified over 2000 papers of which 489 were carefully analyzed. From these papers, 85 studies from 48 papers could be used in a quantitative meta-analysis assessment. Results were analyzed for case studies versus climatological assessments, observational versus modeling studies and for day versus night. Results highlight that urbanization modifies rainfall, such that mean precipitation is enhanced by 18\% downwind of the city, 16\% over the city, 2\% on the left and 4\% on the right with respect to the storm direction. The rainfall enhancement occurred approximately 20-50 km from the city center. Study results help develop a more complete picture of the role of urban processes in rainfall modification and highlight that rainfall increases not only downwind of the city but also over the city. These findings have implications for urban flooding as well as hydroclimatological studies. This meta-analysis highlights the need for standardizing how the results are presented in future studies to aid the generalization of findings.},

	abstract = {We analyze flash flooding in small urban watersheds, with special focus on the roles of rainfall variability, antecedent soil moisture, and urban storm water management infrastructure in storm event hydrologic response. Our results are based on empirical analyses of high‐resolution rainfall and discharge observations over Harry's Brook watershed in Princeton, New Jersey, during 2005–2006, as well as numerical experiments with the Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA) model. We focus on two subwatersheds of Harry's Brook, a 1.1 km2 subwatershed which was developed prior to modern storm water management regulations, and a 0.5 km2 subwatershed with an extensive network of storm water detention ponds. The watershed developed prior to modern storm water regulations is an “end‐member” in urban flood response, exhibiting a frequency of flood peaks (with unit discharge exceeding 1 m3 s−1 km−2) that is comparable to the “flashiest” watersheds in the conterminous U.S. Observational analyses show that variability in storm event water balance is strongly linked to peak rain rates at time intervals of less than 30 min and only weakly linked to antecedent soil moisture conditions. Peak discharge for both the 1.1 and 0.5 km2 subwatersheds are strongly correlated with rainfall rate averaged over 1–30 min. Hydrologic modeling analyses indicate that the sensitivity of storm event hydrologic response to spatial rainfall variability decreases with storm intensity. Temporal rainfall variability is relatively more important than spatial rainfall variability in representing urban flood response, especially for extreme storm events. Key Points Storm water balance is strongly linked to peak rain rates at time intervals less than 30 min Temporal rainfall variability is more important in hydrologic response than its spatial counterpart The sensitivity of flood response to spatial rainfall variability is conditioned on storm intensity},

	abstract = {Rainfall exhibits substantial variability, and its temporal resolution considerably affects simulation of hydrological processes. This study aims to investigate the effect of the temporal resolution of rainfall (TRR) on urban flood modeling and to explore how high TRR is required. A routing-enhanced detailed urban stormwater (REDUS) model, which has four layers and accounts for complex urban flow paths, was developed and then applied to the campus of Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. For 30 rainfall events at 1-min resolution, the rainfall accuracy index (RAI) was used to describe the discrepancy of rainfall patterns by upscaling. Through hydrodynamic modelling, the effect of TRR was quantified by the relative error of flood volume and peak in typical areas. The results show that (1) flood peak is sensitive to TRR while flood volume is generally not; (2) with lower TRR, discharge peak is underestimated, and a power function is proposed to express the relationship between the effect of TRR and the characteristics of rainfall and underlying surfaces; and (3) rainfall data of 5-min resolution for urban areas smaller than 1 km2, or at least 15-min resolution for larger areas, are required to constrain the relative biases of flood peak within 10\%.},

	abstract = {The spatial–temporal characteristics of rainfall is one of the important elements affecting urban inundation. In this work, the effect of spatial–temporal characteristics of rainfall on urban inundation processes was investigated. To solve the problem that it is difficult to acquire the spatial–temporal characteristics of rainfall, the weather generator model was used to generate rainfall data in accordance with the climatic conditions of the study area. Then, precise rainfall data with 1 km2 spatial resolution and 5 min temporal resolution were obtained through the downscaling method. Finally, the GAST hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the urban inundation processes under different rainfall scenarios. The simulated results show that the inundation area and the inundation water volume increase with the rainfall spatial–temporal heterogeneity, and the inundation peak time lags behind. The impact of rainfall spatial–temporal heterogeneity on inundation weakens as the rainfall return period prolongs. When the rainfall spatial heterogeneity increases, the high‐risk inundation area enlarges, while the low‐risk inundation area shrinks. The temporal distribution of rainfall exerts the greatest impact on the inundation peak time. The research results can help researchers understand the key effects of the spatial–temporal characteristics of rainfall on urban inundation, and obtain relatively reliable simulated inundation results even without detailed information of the spatial–temporal characteristics of rainfall. Based on the GAST numerical model and scenario analysis, this study investigated the influence of spatial–temporal characteristic of rainfall on urban inundation processes.},

	abstract = {The performance of urban drainage systems is typically examined using hydrological and hydrodynamic models where rainfall input is uniformly distributed, i.e., derived from a single or very few rain gauges. When models are fed with a single uniformly distributed rainfall realization, the response of the urban drainage system to the rainfall variability remains unexplored. The goal of this study was to understand how climate variability and spatial rainfall variability, jointly or individually considered, affect the response of a calibrated hydrodynamic urban drainage model. A stochastic spatially distributed rainfall generator (STREAP – Space-Time Realizations of Areal Precipitation) was used to simulate many realizations of rainfall for a 30-year period, accounting for both climate variability and spatial rainfall variability. The generated rainfall ensemble was used as input into a calibrated hydrodynamic model (EPA SWMM – the US EPA's Storm Water Management Model) to simulate surface runoff and channel flow in a small urban catchment in the city of Lucerne, Switzerland. The variability of peak flows in response to rainfall of different return periods was evaluated at three different locations in the urban drainage network and partitioned among its sources. The main contribution to the total flow variability was found to originate from the natural climate variability (on average over 74 \%). In addition, the relative contribution of the spatial rainfall variability to the total flow variability was found to increase with longer return periods. This suggests that while the use of spatially distributed rainfall data can supply valuable information for sewer network design (typically based on rainfall with return periods from 5 to 15 years), there is a more pronounced relevance when conducting flood risk assessments for larger return periods. The results show the importance of using multiple distributed rainfall realizations in urban hydrology studies to capture the total flow variability in the response of the urban drainage systems to heavy rainfall events.},

	abstract = {Urban pluvial flooding is one of the most costly natural hazards worldwide. Risks of flooding are expected to increase in the future due to global warming and urbanization. The complexity of the involved processes and the lack of long-term field observations means that many crucial aspects related to urban flood risks still remain poorly understood. In this paper, the possibility to gain new insight into urban pluvial flooding using citizen flood observations is explored. Using a ten-year dataset of radar rainfall maps and 70,000 citizen flood reports for the city of Rotterdam, we derive critical thresholds beyond which urban pluvial flooding is likely to occur. Three binary decision trees are trained for predicting flood occurrences based on peak rainfall intensities across different temporal scales. Results show that the decision trees correctly predict 37\%–52\% of all flood occurrences and 95\%–97\% of all non-flood occurrences, which is a fair performance given the uncertainties associated with citizen data. More importantly, all models agree on which rainfall features are the most important for predicting flooding, reaching optimal performance whenever short- and long-duration rainfall peak intensities are combined together to make a prediction. Additional feature selection using principal component analysis shows that further improvement is possible when critical rainfall thresholds are calculated using a linear combination of peak rainfall intensities across multiple temporal scales. The encouraging results suggest that citizen observatories, although prone to larger errors and uncertainties, constitute a valuable alternative source of information for gaining insight into urban pluvial flooding.

The objective of this study is to develop a broad characterization of land surface and hydrometeorological controls of urban flood hydrology. Our analyses are based on peaks‐over‐threshold flood data developed from USGS streamflow observations and are motivated by problems of flood hazard characterization for urban regions. We examine flood‐producing rainfall using high‐resolution (1 km2 spatial resolution and 15 min time resolution), bias‐corrected radar rainfall fields that are developed through the Hydro‐NEXRAD system.

Advances in radar hardware, data processing, numerical models, and emerging fields within urban hydrology necessitate an updated review of the state of the art in such radar rainfall data and applications. Three key areas with significant advances over the past decade have been identified: (1) temporal and spatial resolution of rainfall data required for different types of hydrological applications, (2) rainfall estimation, radar data adjustment and data quality, and (3) nowcasting of radar rainfall and real-time applications. Based on these three fields of research, the paper provides recommendations based on an updated overview of shortcomings, gains, and novel developments in relation to urban hydrological applications. The paper also reviews how the focus in urban hydrology research has shifted over the last decade to fields such as climate change impacts, resilience of urban areas to hydrological extremes, and online prediction/warning systems.

	abstract = {Radar‐rain gauge merging techniques have been widely used to improve the applicability of radar and rain gauge rainfall estimates by combining their advantages, while partially overcoming their individual weaknesses. Despite significant research in this area, guidance on the suitability of and factors affecting merging techniques at the fine spatial‐temporal resolutions required for urban hydrological applications is still insufficient. In this paper, an in‐depth review of radar‐rain gauge merging techniques is conducted, with a focus on their potential for urban hydrological applications. An overview is first given of existing merging techniques and an application‐oriented categorization is proposed: (1) radar bias adjustment methods, (2) rain gauge interpolation methods using radar spatial association as additional information, and (3) radar‐rain gauge integration methods. A detailed review is given of studies focusing on the evaluation and intercomparison of merging methods, based upon which the most widely used and best performing techniques from each category are identified. These are mean field bias adjustment, kriging with external drift, and Bayesian merging. Climatological, operational, and methodological factors affecting merging performance are then reviewed and their relevance for urban applications discussed. Based on this review, conclusions on merging potential for urban applications are drawn and research gaps are identified, which should be addressed to provide further guidance on the use of merging techniques for urban hydrological applications. Key Points An in‐depth review of radar‐rain gauge merging methods is presented, which compiles much of the work undertaken in this area to date It includes a categorization of methods, summary of merging intercomparison studies to date, and factors affecting merging performance The potential and challenges of applying merging at the fine spatial‐temporal resolutions required for urban hydrology are discussed},
