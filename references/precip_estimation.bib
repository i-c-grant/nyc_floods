	abstract = {New York City (NYC) is an ultra-urban region, with over 50\% impervious cover and buried stream channels. Traditional flood studies rely on the presence of stream gages to detect flood stage and discharge, but these methods cannot be used in ultra-urban areas. Here we create a high-resolution radar rainfall dataset for NYC and utilize citizen and expert reports of flooding throughout the city to study flash flooding in NYC. Results indicate that interactions between the urban area and land–sea boundary have an important impact on the spatial variability of both heavy rainfall and flooding, sometimes in contrast to results obtained for other cities. Top days of daily and hourly rainfall exhibit a rainfall maximum over the city center and an extended region of higher rainfall downwind of the city. The mechanism for flooding appears to vary across the city, with high groundwater tables influencing more coastal areas and high rain rates or large rain volumes influencing more inland areas. There is also a strong relationship between sewer type and flood frequency, with fewer floods observed in combined sewer areas. Flooding is driven by maximum one-hour to one-day rainfall, which is often substantially less rain than observed for the city-wide daily maximum.},

	abstract = {High-quality and high-resolution precipitation products are critically important to many hydrological applications. Advances in satellite remote sensing instruments and data retrieval algorithms continue to improve the quality of the operational precipitation products. However, most satellite products existing today are still too coarse to be ingested for local water management and planning purposes. Recent advances in deep learning algorithms enable the fusion of multi-source, high-dimensional data for statistical learning. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of an attention-based, deep convolutional neural network (AU-Net) for learning spatial and temporal mappings from coarse-resolution to fine-resolution precipitation products. The skills of AU-Net models, developed using combinations of static and dynamic predictors, were evaluated over a 3 × 3° study area in Central Texas, U.S., a region known for its complex precipitation patterns and low predictability. Three coarse-resolution satellite/reanalysis precipitation products, ERA5-Land (0.1°), TRMM (0.25°), and IMERG (0.1°), are used as part of the inputs, while the predictand is the 1-km PRISM data. Auxiliary predictors include elevation, vegetation index, and air temperature. The study period includes 18 years of data (2001–2018) at the monthly scale for training, validation, and testing. Results show that the trained AU-Net models achieve different degrees of success in downscaling the baseline coarse-resolution products, depending on the total precipitation, the accuracy of large-scale patterns captured by the baseline products, and the amount of information transferable from predictors. Higher precipitation rate tends to affect AU-Net model performance negatively. Use of the attention mechanism in the AU-Net models allows for infilling of multiscale features and generation of sharper images. Correction using gauge data, if there is any, can further improve the results significantly.},

Radar rainfall estimates with daily mean field bias (MFB) correction accurately capture the spatial and temporal structure of extreme rainfall, but bias correction at finer timescales can improve cold‐season and tropical cyclone rainfall estimates. Approximately 25 rain gages are sufficient to estimate daily MFB over an area of at least 2,500 km

A variety of customized modules implemented in Hydro-NEXRAD perform radar-reflectivity data processing, produce radar-rainfall maps with user-requested space and time resolution, and combine multiple radar data for basins covered by multiple radars. System users can select rainfall estimation algorithms that range from simple (‘Quick Look’) to complex and computing-intensive (‘Hi-Fi’). The ‘Pseudo NWS PPS’ option allows close comparison with the algorithm used operationally by the US National Weather Service. The ‘Custom’ algorithm enables expert users to specify values for many of the parameters in the algorithm modules according to their experience and expectations.

The radar processing library wradlib is intended to lower these barriers by providing a free and open source tool for the most important steps in processing weather radar data for hydro-meteorological and hydrological applications. Moreover, the community-based development approach of wradlib allows scientists to share their knowledge about efficient processing algorithms and to make this knowledge available to the weather radar community in a transparent, structured and well-documented way.},

However, due to the intricate temporospatial variability and the intermittent nature of precipitation, it is challenging to obtain QPE with adequate accuracy. This paper aims to simulate rainfall fields while honoring both the local constraints imposed by the point-wise rain gauge observations and the global constraints imposed by the field measurements obtained from weather radar. The conditional simulation method employed in this study is modified phase annealing (PA), which is practically an evolution from the traditional simulated annealing (SA). Yet unlike SA, which implements perturbations in the spatial field, PA implements perturbations in Fourier space, making it superior to SA in many respects. PA is developed in two ways. First, taking advantage of the global characteristic of PA, the method is only used to deal with global constraints, and the local ones are handed over to residual kriging. Second, except for the system temperature, the number of perturbed phases is also annealed during the simulation process, making the influence of the perturbation more global at initial phases and decreasing the global impact of the perturbation gradually as the number of perturbed phases decreases. The proposed method is used to simulate the rainfall field for a 30 min event using different scenarios: with and without integrating the uncertainty of the radar-indicated rainfall pattern and with different objective functions.},

            A review of existing tools for radar data processing revealed a lack of open source software for automated processing, assessment and analysis of weather radar composites. The ArcGIS-compatible Python package radproc attempts to reduce this gap. Radproc provides an automated raw data processing workflow for nationwide, freely available German weather radar climatology (RADKLIM) and operational (RADOLAN) composite products. Raw data are converted into a uniform HDF5 file structure used by radproc's analysis and data quality assessment functions. This enables transferability of the developed analysis and export functionality to other gridded or point-scale precipitation data. Thus, radproc can be extended by additional import routines to support any other German or non-German precipitation dataset. Analysis methods include temporal aggregations, detection of heavy rainfall and an automated processing of rain gauge point data into the same HDF5 format for comparison to gridded radar data. A set of functions for data exchange with ArcGIS allows for visualisation and further geospatial analysis. The application on a 17-year time series of hourly RADKLIM data showed that radproc greatly facilitates radar data processing and analysis by avoiding manual programming work and helps to lower the barrier for non-specialists to work with these novel radar climatology datasets.},

            Weather radar analysis has become increasingly sophisticated over the past 50 years, and efforts to keep software up to date have generally lagged behind the needs of the users. We argue that progress has been impeded by the fact that software has not been developed and shared as a community.
            Recently, the situation has been changing. In this paper, the developers of a number of open-source software (OSS) projects highlight the potential of OSS to advance radar-related research. We argue that the community-based development of OSS holds the potential to reduce duplication of efforts and to create transparency in implemented algorithms while improving the quality and scope of the software. We also conclude that there is sufficiently mature technology to support collaboration across different software projects. This could allow for consolidation toward a set of interoperable software platforms, each designed to accommodate very specific user requirements.},
