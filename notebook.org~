* Next steps
** TODO investigate hydrodynamic flood models that have been used/could be used in NYC
** TODO talk to Sean about overall project and DEM 
** TODO reach out to Floodbase person
** DONE reach out to FloodNet person
*** is there an API for accessing the FloodNet data?
** TODO reach out to Bhibash
** TODO research other products that NYC might have


* Questions
** DONE temporal resolution
Is there enough overlap between pluvial flash floods and SAR for flood
maps to be useful? For the remote sensing part, may be necessary to do
big coastal flooding events instead. Train on coastal flooding events
then use to detect pluvial flooding?

Even then, though, does pluvial flooding last long enough to reliably
overlap with, say, a daily capture? Would a daily pluvial flooding
snapshot be useful, or is the process of flooding and drainage usually
too fast?

If so, would a coastal-flooding-based approach be preferable, assuming
it lasts longer? Or maybe just build around coastal flooding and then
test out performance for pluvial.

*** Update <2024-01-27 Sat>
Sentinel-1 seems worse than I expected in this regard, often very long
revisit time. The SAR data might just be too scarce to be worth the
trouble.

** TODO rainfall intensity
How to include rainfall intensity, not just precip. amount? Need rate
of rainfall. To calc. some variable like "rainfall in last 30 mins" or
hour Or model as precip. - rate of runoff/infiltration?

** potential flood mapping plan
*** pseudo-labelling
- run local hydrodynamic flood models around FloodNet sensors
- use model output to get pseudo-labels of flooded and non-flooded pixels
*** training 
- based on local flood modelling, each training pixel now has a classification history
- get classification corresponding to each Sentinel-1 capture in the study period
- train CNN on resulting dataset
  - stacked CNN can also incorporate one-day-ago history
  - but maybe this will not be necessary?

*** Hurricane Sandy CNN case study
- just try to do a CNN like in the literature but use NYC instead of Houston, etc.
- if this succeeds, try to make a physically constrained CNN, where
  loss function has a component that is determined by a physical flood
  model (could be simple as just penalizing for high elevation)

Tried to find SAR data for NYC, but not sure that there is any with
sufficient temporal resolution.

[[RADARSAT - https://www.eodms-sgdot.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/index-en.html][RADARSAT doesn't seem to have much for NYC]]
Sentinel-1 is low temporal res.

Terra SAR X requires a proposal
COSMO SkyMed requires a proposal

311 data could be useful

Potential different project idea: focus on "interpolating" FloodNet
This could then also have a WebGIS component

* <2024-01-28 Sun>
** DONE emailed info@floodnet.net about data availability

* <2024-01-30 Tue>
Spoke with Jochen about project. He raised doubts about inundation
extent mapping given the complexity of hydrological modelling, since
much of the connectivity is underground. I mentioned how there wasn't
enough SAR and he suggested simulating it through a physical model,
but I don't think that's feasible.

I downloaded 311 data from the Sept. 2023 event. There are about 1,000
311 calls about blocked sewers just from those three days, and they
have coordinates. It seems promising that FloodNet sensors and 311
call datasets are both continuous in time. If we have FloodNet + 311 +
dense meteorological data + DEM, how much could we infer about areas
where the stormwater system has been overwhelmed? How would those
different parts of the model fit together?

Precipitation --> urban structure and infrastructure --> street flooding

Street flooding --> FloodNet readings

Street flooding --> human behavior --> 311 calls

* <2024-02-01 Thu>
** Planning
New way to think about project: explain/detect spatial patterns in 311
requests driven by: meteorology, sewer infrastructure, terrain.

This approach has been used before by Open Sewer Atlas person and
Agonafir et al. (2022). But we can use a more sophisticated
point-pattern analysis instead of aggregating 311 calls into areas,
and can also include the time dimension with continuous meteorological
data and, ideally, FloodNet data.

FloodNet not essential but could use to establish some relatioships
between 311 complaints--indication of nuisance flooding--to physical
inundation.

** Possible methods
*** spatstat: R package for point pattern analysis
*** string-of-pearls model
*** line segment model

** Observation
In the 9-30 event, southern Brooklyn was hit first. Then the rest of
Brooklyn, then a cluster in Queens that looks like it might be along a
line, i.e. a sewer main.

- In theory, could model impact of DEP green infrastructure. Do they
reduce 311 calls compared to model expectation?

- Is there a statistical test for an unexpectedly linear arrangement
  of points, instead of just a cluster? Could help to identify pipes
  at

* <2024-02-02 Fri>
** investigation of dataset
*** downloaded "flooding" 311 calls from the whole record
**** ~150,000 calls
**** Sandy shows clear pattern of calls along coasts
** notes from Eric Sanderson talk
Lucinda Royte is name of research assistant at NYBG, I think she did
the GIS stuff

*** 311 call analysis
They did some, but I don't think anything statistically complex

*** Rainproof NYC
ongoing collaboration convening gov., nonprofit,
design firms to come up with flooding solutions

*** Ecological vs. civil engineering approaches
**** Hydrology
incoming precip. --> infiltration, evapotranspiration, runoff
**** Hydraulic
incoming precip. --> little infiltration, little evapotranspiration, high runoff

*** Relevant factors to flooding
**** Permeability 
**** Height of water table
***** long island has aquifers
**** Bedrock depth
**** Historical flooding--reconstructed hydrology of past NYC
**** Predicted flood maps

*** "Blue zone" concept
**** GIS overlay of past, present, and future flooding
**** Idea is that these areas will flood, need nature-based interventions

* <2024-02-09 Fri>
** meeting with Brett Branco
*** New School flood maps
*** FloodNet should be up to 500 sensors within next few years
*** wants to introduce me to the rest of the team
*** they want to do finer-grained precipitation stuff
*** will be in contact with Polly for data

* <2024-02-15 Thu>
** project for remote sensing class--impervious surfaces over time in NYC?
better fit for GEE

* <2024-02-17 Sat>
** impervious idea
Issue with impervious idea is that there's not much change in NYC over that period. DEP did a study of impervious materials using segmentation then supervised classification. Maybe it would be possible to do a better classification using more hyperspectral data, but unclear if spatial res. over those satellites is good enough.

** air pollution idea
Wenge floated doing an air pollution deep learning project instead of the impervious idea. The general idea is to incorporate ground sensor data with satellite data through deep learning. This has been tried with mixed results in NYC; unclear if current satellite data actually helps much in NYC specifically. However, TEMPO is about to be released and will provide hourly, relatively coarse NO2 estimates at sub-urban scale. Best to wait for TEMPO and use it to test congestion pricing effect?

** precipitation idea
For the 311 project, I will ideally need high temporal, moderate spatial resolution precipitation data. PRISM provides daily gauge-based estimates using a regression model at 4 km spatial res. GPM provides two possibly useful products: .1° hourly rain and 4km 3-hourly rain. I could try to temporalize the daily PRISM data using the satellite patterns, then verify temporally against gauge data.

Potential issue: final 4-km IMERG is already gauge-adjusted, and PRISM is gauge-based. So how would my product differ from IMERG? In theory, the answer is that would be a temporally decomposed representation of the PRISM model based on satellite temporal patterns; in contrast, IMERG is a gauge-corrected representation of satellite data. This seems promising because gauge data is better than satellite data for precipitation anyway, but satellites can uniquely capture the overall spatiotemporal pattern. So we can take PRISM as the "ground truth" and try to "animate" a given day of PRISM based on that day's satellite data.

** California atmospheric river idea
Just follow GEE flood detection methodology from the paper w/ John Armston to analyze the extent of flooding from atmospheric rivers in California using Sentinel SAR.

** Spatial precipitation map generator
- Python tool where you specify ROI and optionally provide rain gauge
CSVs
- Tool downloads weather radar from Google Cloud Storage, processes to get precipitation estimates, and does gauge correction if possible
