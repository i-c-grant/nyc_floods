# Challenge of urban pluvial flooding


# Difficult to sense with SAR, difficult to model

# Pluvial flooding is mainly precipitation-driven

# Ground-based weather radar provides very good spatial resolution of precipitation

# However, radar reflectance must be processed to obtain precipitation

# Therefore, while studies periodically publish spatial precipitation
# datasets for specific cities and timeframes, these quickly become
# outdated and have low spatial coverage

# It would be better to make a tool that generates spatial precipitation from NEXRAD Doppler radar given a timeframe, region, and gauge measurements

# Several open source libaries exist for weather radar processing, but to my knowledge not as an app

# Goal of the project is to make a tool to extract gauge-corrected spatial precipitation estimates

# Can also use in order to evaluate the accuracy of satellite radar products like GPM and gauge interpolation products like PRISM
